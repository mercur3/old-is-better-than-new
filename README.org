* Old is better than new
** Description
An extension for Firefox that redirects the request from new Reddit site to the old one.

** Why to use this extension
- New Reddit bad ❌! Slow, consumes a lot of RAM, 1 million trackers spying on you.
- Old Reddit good ✅! Fast, ..., that's it. (no dark mode support 🥺)
